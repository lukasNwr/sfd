# Shifts Hours Calculator

> This is simple web application for calculating shifts for my work. I have to send the total hours and shifts to my boss every week in message and it's just annoying to do this calculation. Previously I have create python script that would convert and count everything for me from csv file. I have used ChatGPT to get the info from screenshot and then convert it to csv file. But then I just wanted to try the v0 and make something with it.

## More info
